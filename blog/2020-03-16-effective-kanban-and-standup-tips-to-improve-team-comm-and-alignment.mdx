This short blog describes some techniques to keep development squads productive focusing on the daily Standup ritual and the Kanban workflow. The advice given is applicable to both co-located and remote squads. However, for remote squads where communication and alignment are more challenging, it is even more imperative.

One of the key rituals for teams building products is the Standup. The standup is the ritual that occurs most often and on a daily basis. The Standup typically lasts no more than 15 minutes. It gives each contributor to the team (developer, designer, architect, product owner, etc.) the opportunity to discuss what they are working on and any blockers they may have.

The Kanban method is what agile teams use to manage the workflow of the team. Essentially the Kanban workflow manages the process of getting user stories prioritized all the way to being accepted by the product owner.

An effective Kanban workflow will lead to effective standups and keep the team aligned on the common goal which is to build the MVP.

Based on my experiences, some best practices for managing the Kanban workflow are:

* Keep the workflow as simple as possible
* Represent all stages needed to get stories accepted including any manual steps
* Keep the state of the user stories up to date
* Continuously optimize by automating any manual stages
