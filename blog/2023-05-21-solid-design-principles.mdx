Delivering cloud native apps to users with speed and quality requires a fully automated solution including a comprehensive test suite providing confidence that the application behaves as expected under all known conditions.

TDD (test-driven development) has become a popular method to design and develop software to ensure that the code base is sufficiently tested and its behavior is captured in tests.

A common complaint I keep hearing from developers who are on projects where TDD is practiced is that maintaining code (e.g. adding new features, fixing bugs, refactoring) becomes difficult because there are too many tests and most of their time is consumed fixing tests.

Sometimes this can happen because tests attempt to capture more behavior than they should, or perhaps, the application design needs to be optimized to better demarcate boundaries of responsibility that can easily be tested.
The ideal state to achieve is one where your tests capture the complete behavior of the application without sacrificing the maintainability of the code to enable development teams to go fast.

I have found that while developing software using a TDD approach, designing the application using the SOLID design principles results in fewer overall tests that better capture the behavior of the application.

In this paper, we will discuss the five SOLID design principles in the context of a mortgage calculator application and demonstrate how it promotes a well-designed application and enables simpler and fewer tests that are easier to maintain without sacrificing capturing the expected behavior of the entire application.

TDD is an acronym that stands for test-driven development, which means that tests are written first, and then followed by the code to make the test pass.
TDD is one of the main tenets of XP (Extreme Programming), which has gained a lot of traction in the industry.

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that make code easier to understand, easier to test, easier to maintain and more flexible. Robert C. Martin, one of the key authors of the Agile Manifesto is a big proponent of both TDD and SOLID design principles. The SOLID principles were first conceptualized by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper.
