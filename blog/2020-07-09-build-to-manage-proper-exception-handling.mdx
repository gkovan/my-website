Exception handling continues to be one of the more challenging aspects when designing and writing code. Poor exception handling leads to many problems such as:

· poorly designed code that is difficult to understand, test and refactor

· difficult to diagnose the root cause of errors

· poor logging

· poor monitoring

These problems not only make working with the code difficult from a perspective of refactoring and adding new features, but it also makes managing the application in production environments extremely difficult.

The antidote to these problems involves applying the following best practices:

· apply the single responsibility design principles to exception handling

· proper exception handling and logging of exceptions

· provide meaningful error codes and error messages

· enable distributed tracing

· apply best practice API design for returning HTTP status codes

In this blog, we will explain how each of these best practices can avoid the pitfalls of poor exception handling and allow you to build apps that are easier to manage. A sample mortgage calculator microservice application written using the Java Spring Boot framework is used to demonstrate the concepts however the techniques can be applied to any language.
