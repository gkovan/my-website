One of the frustrating things when creating API’s is choosing appropriate HTTP status codes that follow best practices and is consistent with the way it was intended to be used. There always seems to be a lot of debate about what HTTP status code to use for particular situations. There are obviously guiding principles from the HTTP specification, however there is enough ambiguity in the standard for the debates and usage to vary quite a bit. That is why questions and discussions about this topic on sites such as stackoverflow and others have many different opinions and thoughts which can be confusing to developers.

This article provides some good resources that I found useful in order to choose the most appropriate HTTP status codes while building API’s.
