When working on digital transformation projects, payment card industry (PCI) and personally identifiable information (PII) compliance is one of the top requirements that must be addressed. Organizations that violate PCI and PII compliance can pay fines into the millions of dollars as well as incur other significant costs to remedy the data breach[1]. Digital transformation projects typically involve developing new modern business applications using microservices architectures. Logging data and events is an essential part of the application in order to allow developers to diagnose and understand runtime behavior of the applications. When logging the data of the microservices process, the data typically has many occurrences of both PCI and PII data, so it is imperative that it be handled in an appropriate and compliant manner.

This article will address how we handled it on several digital enterprise transformation projects. We will use a sample mortgage calculator application to demonstrate the key concepts to ensure your digital transformation project meets PCI and PII requirements. We developed our sample app microservices using Spring Boot, a java based microservices framework; however the concepts can be applied to any programming language and framework.
